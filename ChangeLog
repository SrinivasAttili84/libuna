* add strict test
  libuca_utf16_string_size_from_utf16_stream
  libuca_utf16_string_copy_from_utf16_stream
  libuca_utf16_stream_copy_from_utf16
  libuca_utf32_string_size_from_utf32_stream
  libuca_utf32_string_copy_from_utf32_stream
  libuca_utf32_stream_copy_from_utf32

* check current codepages
* add more code pages?

* copy from/to functions should return amount of bytes successfully processed?

* refactor to use separate utf8/16/32 copy_byte_order_mark functions?

* find and replace uitwisselplatform.nl

Tools:
* ucaexport
  - add conversion summary (converting from x to y with codepage z) +/-
  - show bytes per second?
  - update man page
  - allow for both input and output codepage?
* ucainfo
  tool to determine the encoding type using the byte order mark
  perhaps some other tricks
  useful for automated conversion
  - write man page
  - update ucaexport manpage 
    .Sh SEE ALSO
    .Xr ucainfo 1
  - update spec.in file

Deployment:
* create debian package files
* fix AUTHORS
* update macosx package files

* Worked on initial version
* Integrated local use of libuca using HAVE_LOCAL_LIBUCA for maintenance
* implemented utf8/16 to/from utf32_stream functions
* detection of endian defaults to big if no endianess could be determined
* added detection of UTF-8 byte order mark
* Worked on refactoring _streams to separate files change copy_to_ functions into copy_from
* Implemented libuca_utf16_string_size_from_utf8, libuca_utf32_string_size_from_utf8
