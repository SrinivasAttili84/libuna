TODO

* ucaexport implement process_status
* ucaexport implement signal handling

* handle combining characters in windows 1255 and 1258 ?
* add more code pages?

* change libuca_codepage_ macros into inline functions

* copy from/to functions should set/return amount of bytes successfully processed?
  most of the time not needed because the size of the string was already
  determined

Tools:
* ucaexport
  - add conversion summary (converting from x to y with codepage z) +/-
  - add completion summary, show bytes per second?
  - update man page
  - allow for different input and output codepage?
  - implement basic globbing support for Windows?
* ucainfo
  tool to determine the encoding type using the byte order mark
  perhaps some other tricks
  useful for automated conversion
  - write man page
  - update ucaexport manpage 
    .Sh SEE ALSO
    .Xr ucainfo 1
  - update spec.in file
  - update msvscpp project files

Deployment:
* create debian package files
* fix AUTHORS
* update macosx package files
