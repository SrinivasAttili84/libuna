TODO
* libuna
  - add source == destination check to functions?
  - handle combining characters in windows 1255 and 1258 ?
  - add more code pages?
  - speed test between index based and pointer based iteration
  - change libuna_codepage_ macros into inline functions ?
  - copy from/to functions should set/return amount of bytes successfully processed?
    most of the time not needed because the size of the string was already
    determined

* unatools
  - update system string

* unaexport
  - what happens when exporting UTF16LE as UTF16BE to UTF16LE with the BOM
  - implement signal handling
  - add conversion summary (converting from x to y with codepage z) +/-
  - update man page
  - allow for different input and output codepage?
  - implement basic globbing support for Windows?
  - determine total source file size for process status
  - add option to set buffer size?
  - check if input file is output file?

* unainfo
  - create a tool to determine the encoding type using the byte order mark
    perhaps some other tricks
    might be useful for automated conversion
  - write man page
  - update unaexport manpage 
    .Sh SEE ALSO
